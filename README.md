# StupidPySystem
A really stupid Python "system" (It's more like a program with smaller programs in it, Or an app launcher.)

(I don't have any experience with Python)

## Information
Currently the file **only** supports Windows, There is support for macOS and Linux probably coming soon.

This is not supposed to be an operating system, If I had the knowledge on how to make one, I would've.
